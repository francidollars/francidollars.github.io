title: Online Multiplayer Euchre App
categories: Projects
---
Description:
	Project to create a online multiplayer android application based on the card game euchre. This application would allow the user to create a account with the application enabling the user to create or join ongoing euchre games with three other players. All game logic and turns are handled by the application, with restrictions in place to align with the rules of the game.

User account information is stored within a SQL database within the backend server of the app. This allows the user to login to already existing accounts, well also restricting duplicate accounts. The application also allows for users to communicate with others via a post-game chat room where users can discuss the game and share "gg"s.

To develop this application the team utilized Spring Boot to provide backend framework to establish game logic and interact with SQL Database for account information. The frontend of the applcation was created using Android Studio establishing the UI and allowing the user to modify settings like the theme of the applciation.

Role:
	Team Project, Backend Engineer
		My role within this project was to implement the logic of a euchre game into the application. This required writing java methods to establish this logic, as well as, develop a way for all users within a euchre match to stay synced together with all the events ongoing within a game. Due to my contributions to this project, and my communication skills amongst team members and our team's teaching assistant, I was awarded with an 'Outstanding Team Lead' honor.
