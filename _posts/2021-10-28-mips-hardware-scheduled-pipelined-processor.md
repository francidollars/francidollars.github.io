title: MIPS Hardware-Scheduled Pipelined Processor
categories: Projects
---
Description:
CPRE 381 semester long project building a single cycle and pipelined processor based on MIPS architecture. Components were built and studied in phases, individually tested at each step in construction. These components include 32-bit ALU (arithmetic logic unit), processor registers, and control unit to decode instructions given. These modules were created using VHDL, which is a hardware description language used to simulate dataflow and implement logic gates and connections between abstracted components. 

ModelSim by Siemens was used to simulate and debug our VHDL code. After testing our project through a provided testbench, our processor sucessfully executed all MIPS instructions with a maximum frequency of 60.88 mhz. Through this project I had learned about the interworkings of a CPU and the importance of abstraction in computing. The project gave me a complete hands on experience in building computing components that I had not had prior to this project in my academic career.

Below is a pdf of the on-paper schematic of our finalized pipelined processor design. This pdf highlights all of the inputs and outputs and components of our processor design.
