Description:
	CPRE 381 semester long project simulating pipelined processor based on MIPS instruction set. Components were built and learned about in phases and individually tested at each step in creation

Role:
	Partnership

Skills Obtained:
	Assembly level programming, simulating components via VHDL, abstract circuity design

Resources:
  VHDL, ModelSim Software
