Description: </br>
Use C-Programming on Tivaâ„¢ TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller to control roomba navigation from a remote desktop. This project delved into embedded programming on said microcontroller to drive a roomba around obstacles set on an unknown course. Our team was tasked with utilizing various sensors present on the roomba and intreperting this data in order to navigate this roomba within a designated area.
