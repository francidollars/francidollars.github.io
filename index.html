    Hi! My name is Mickey Doyle and I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at Iowa State University. I am an avid programmer outside of acedmics whether it's website or mobile application development, or even embedded systems for robotics.

  <h3 style="text-align:left;">Career Objectives</h3>
  <p>
    I have many interests in the computer space, however, I am mostly interested in working in the embedded systems space. I really enjoyed my experiences working in the Robotics Club at Iowa State University I've grown supremely interested in Robotics and would love to explore that space professionally.
